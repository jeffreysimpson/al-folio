  abstract={The European Space Agency (ESA) Gaia mission has enabled the remarkable discovery that a large fraction of the stars near the solar neighbourhood are debris from a single in-falling system, the so-called Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). This discovery provides astronomers for the first time with a large cohort of easily observable, unevolved stars that formed in a single extragalactic environment. Here we use these stars to investigate the 'Spite plateau' - the near-constant lithium abundance observed in unevolved metal-poor stars across a wide range of metallicities (-3 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -1). Our aim is to test whether individual galaxies could have different Spite plateaus - e.g. the interstellar medium could be more depleted in lithium in a lower galactic mass system due to it having a smaller reservoir of gas. We identified 93 GSE dwarf stars observed and analysed by the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey as part of its Data Release 3 (DR3). Orbital actions were used to select samples of GSE stars, and comparison samples of halo and disc stars. We find that the GSE stars show the same lithium abundance as other likely accreted stars and in situ Milky Way stars. Formation environment leaves no imprint on lithium abundances. This result fits within the growing consensus that the Spite plateau, and more generally the 'cosmological lithium problem' - the observed discrepancy between the amount of lithium in warm, metal-poor dwarf stars in our Galaxy, and the amount of lithium predicted to have been produced by big bang nucleosynthesis - is the result of lithium depletion processes within stars.},

  abstract={The ensemble of chemical element abundance measurements for stars, along with precision distances and orbit properties, provides high-dimensional data to study the evolution of the Milky Way. With this third data release of the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey, we publish 678 423 spectra for 588 571 mostly nearby stars (81.2 per cent of stars are within &lt;2 kpc), observed with the HERMES spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. This release (hereafter GALAH+ DR3) includes all observations from GALAH Phase 1 (bright, main, and faint survey, 70 per cent), K2-HERMES (17 per cent), TESS-HERMES (5 per cent), and a subset of ancillary observations (8 per cent) including the bulge and &gt;75 stellar clusters. We derive stellar parameters T<SUB>eff</SUB>, log g, [Fe/H], v<SUB>mic</SUB>, v<SUB>broad</SUB>, and v<SUB>rad</SUB> using our modified version of the spectrum synthesis code Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) and 1D MARCS model atmospheres. We break spectroscopic degeneracies in our spectrum analysis with astrometry from Gaia DR2 and photometry from 2MASS. We report abundance ratios [X/Fe] for 30 different elements (11 of which are based on non-LTE computations) covering five nucleosynthetic pathways. We describe validations for accuracy and precision, flagging of peculiar stars/measurements and recommendations for using our results. Our catalogue comprises 65 per cent dwarfs, 34 per cent giants, and 1 per cent other/unclassified stars. Based on unflagged chemical composition and age, we find 62 per cent young low-$\alpha$, 9 per cent young high-$\alpha$, 27 per cent old high-$\alpha$, and 2 per cent stars with [Fe/H] ≤ -1. Based on kinematics, 4 per cent are halo stars. Several Value-Added-Catalogues, including stellar ages and dynamics, updated after Gaia eDR3, accompany this release and allow chrono-chemodynamic analyses, as we showcase.},

  abstract={We investigate the properties of 1262 red giant stars with high photospheric abundances of lithium observed by the GALAH and K2-HERMES surveys, and discuss them in the context of proposed mechanisms for lithium enrichment and redepletion in giant stars. We confirm that Li-rich giants are rare, making up only 1.2 per cent of our giant star sample. We use stellar parameters from the third public data release from the GALAH survey and a Bayesian isochrone analysis to divide the sample into first-ascent red giant branch (RGB) and red clump (RC) stars, and confirm these classifications using asteroseismic data from K2. We find that RC stars are 2.5 times as likely to be lithium-rich as RGB stars, in agreement with other recent work. The probability for a star to be lithium-rich is affected by a number of factors, though the causality in those correlations is not entirely clear. We show for the first time that primary and secondary RC stars have distinctly different lithium enrichment patterns. The data set discussed here is large and heterogeneous in terms of evolutionary phase, metallicity, rotation rate, and mass. We expect that if the various mechanisms that have been proposed for lithium enrichment in evolved stars are in fact active, they should all contribute to this sample of lithium-rich giants at some level.},

  abstract={The advent of the second data release of the Gaia mission, in combination with data from large spectroscopic surveys, is revolutionizing our understanding of the Galaxy. Thanks to these transformational data sets and the knowledge accumulated thus far, a new, more mature picture of the evolution of the early Milky Way is currently emerging. Two of the traditional Galactic components, namely, the stellar halo and the thick disk, appear to be intimately linked: Stars with halo-like kinematics originate in similar proportions from a heated (thick) disk and from debris from a system named Gaia-Enceladus. Gaia-Enceladus was the last big merger event experienced by the Milky Way and was completed around 10 Gyr ago. The puffed-up stars now present in the halo as a consequence of the merger have thus exposed the existence of a disk component at z ∼ 1.8. This is likely related to the previously known metal-weak thick disk and may be traceable to metallicities [Fe/H] [Formula: see text] ‑4. As importantly, there is evidence that the merger with Gaia-Enceladus triggered star formation in the early Milky Way, plausibly leading to the appearance of the thick disk as we know it. Other merger events have been characterized better, and new ones have been uncovered. These include, for example, the Helmi streams, Sequoia, and Thamnos, which add to the list of those discovered in wide-field photometric surveys, such as the Sagittarius streams. Current knowledge of their progenitors' properties, star formation, and chemical evolutionary histories is still incomplete. Debris from different objects shows different degrees of overlap in phase-space. This sometimes confusing situation can be improved by determining membership probabilities via quantitative statistical methods. A task for the next few years will be to use ongoing and planned spectroscopic surveys for chemical labeling and to disentangle events from one another using dimensions other than phase-space, metallicity, or [α/Fe]. These large surveys will also provide line-of-sight velocities missing for faint stars in Gaia releases and more accurate distance determinations for distant objects, which in combination with other surveys could also lead to more accurate age dating. The resulting samples of stars will cover a much wider volume of the Galaxy, allowing, for example, the linking of kinematic substructures found in the inner halo to spatial overdensities in the outer halo. All the results obtained so far are in line with the expectations of current cosmological models. Nonetheless, tailored hydrodynamical simulations to reproduce in detail the properties of the merger debris, as well as constrained cosmological simulations of the Milky Way, are needed. Such simulations will undoubtedly unravel more connections between the different Galactic components and their substructures, and will aid in pushing our knowledge of the assembly of the Milky Way to the earliest times.},

This has now been supported by observations of hundreds of thousands of red giant stars<SUP>1-5</SUP>. Here we perform a large-scale systematic investigation into the Li content of stars in the red clump phase of evolution, which directly follows the red giant branch phase. Surprisingly, we find that all red clump stars have high levels of Li for their evolutionary stage, with an increase of a factor of 40 over the end of the red giant branch stage, on average. This suggests that all low-mass stars undergo an Li production phase between the tip of the red giant branch and the red clump. We demonstrate that our finding is not predicted by stellar theory, revealing a stark tension between observations and models. We also show that the well-studied<SUP>1,2,4-6</SUP> very Li-rich giants, with A(Li) &gt; +1.5 dex, represent only the extreme tail of the Li enhancement distribution, comprising 3% of red clump stars.

  abstract={Gravitationally bound clusters that survive gas removal represent an unusual mode of star formation in the Milky Way and similar spiral galaxies. While forming, they can be distinguished observationally from unbound star formation by their high densities, virialized velocity structures, and star formation histories that accelerate towards the present, but extend multiple free-fall times into the past. In this paper, we examine several proposed scenarios for how such structures might form and evolve, and carry out a Bayesian analysis to test these models against observed distributions of protostellar age, counts of young stellar objects relative to gas, and the overall star formation rate of the Milky Way. We show that models in which the acceleration of star formation is due either to a large-scale collapse or a time-dependent increase in star formation efficiency are unable to satisfy the combined set of observational constraints. In contrast, models in which clusters form in a 'conveyor belt' mode where gas accretion and star formation occur simultaneously, but the star formation rate per free-fall time is low, can match the observations.},

  abstract={One of the high-level goals of Galactic archaeology is chemical tagging of stars across the Milky Way to piece together its assembly history. For this to work, stars born together must be uniquely chemically homogeneous. Wide binary systems are an important laboratory to test this underlying assumption. Here, we present the detailed chemical abundance patterns of 50 stars across 25 wide binary systems comprised of main-sequence stars of similar spectral type identified in Gaia DR2 with the aim of quantifying their level of chemical homogeneity. Using high-resolution spectra obtained with McDonald Observatory, we derive stellar atmospheric parameters and precise detailed chemical abundances for light/odd-Z (Li, C, Na, Al, Sc, V, Cu), α (Mg, Si, Ca), Fe-peak (Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn), and neutron capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu) elements. Results indicate that 80 per cent (20 pairs) of the systems are homogeneous in [Fe/H] at levels below 0.02 dex. These systems are also chemically homogeneous in all elemental abundances studied, with offsets and dispersions consistent with measurement uncertainties. We also find that wide binary systems are far more chemically homogeneous than random pairings of field stars of similar spectral type. These results indicate that wide binary systems tend to be chemically homogeneous but in some cases they can differ in their detailed elemental abundances at a level of [X/H] ∼ 0.10 dex, overall implying chemical tagging in broad strokes can work.},

They are ubiquitous in large galaxies and are believed to trace intense star-formation events and the hierarchical build-up of structure<SUP>2,3</SUP>. Observations of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and a wide variety of other galaxies, have found evidence for a `metallicity floor', whereby no globular clusters are found with chemical (metal) abundances below approximately 0.3 to 0.4 per cent of that of the Sun<SUP>4-6</SUP>. The existence of this metallicity floor may reflect a minimum mass and a maximum redshift for surviving globular clusters to form—both critical components for understanding the build-up of mass in the Universe<SUP>7</SUP>. Here we report measurements from the Southern Stellar Streams Spectroscopic Survey of the spatially thin, dynamically cold Phoenix stellar stream in the halo of the Milky Way. The properties of the Phoenix stream are consistent with it being the tidally disrupted remains of a globular cluster. However, its metal abundance ([Fe/H] = -2.7) is substantially below the empirical metallicity floor. The Phoenix stream thus represents the debris of the most metal-poor globular clusters discovered so far, and its progenitor is distinct from the present-day globular cluster population in the local Universe. Its existence implies that globular clusters below the metallicity floor have probably existed, but were destroyed during Galactic evolution.},

  abstract={Using kinematics from Gaia and the large elemental abundance space of the second data release of the GALAH survey, we identify two new members of the Fimbulthul stellar stream, and chemically tag them to massive, multimetallic globular cluster ω Centauri. Recent analysis of the second data release of Gaia had revealed the Fimbulthul stellar stream in the halo of the Milky Way. It had been proposed that the stream is associated with the ω Cen, but this proposition relied exclusively upon the kinematics and metallicities of the stars to make the association. In this work, we find our two new members of the stream to be metal-poor stars that are enhanced in sodium and aluminium, typical of second population globular cluster stars, but not otherwise seen in field stars. Furthermore, the stars share the s-process abundance pattern seen in ω Cen, which is rare in field stars. Apart from one star within 1.5 deg of ω Cen, we find no other stars observed by GALAH spatially near ω Cen or the Fimbulthul stream that could be kinematically and chemically linked to the cluster. Chemically tagging stars in the Fimbulthul stream to ω Cen confirms the earlier work, and further links this tidal feature in the Milky Way halo to ω Cen.},

  abstract={Theoretical models of stellar evolution predict that most of the lithium inside a star is destroyed as the star becomes a red giant. However, observations reveal that about 1% of red giants are peculiarly rich in lithium, often exceeding the amount in the interstellar medium or predicted from the big bang. With only about 150 lithium-rich giants discovered in the past four decades, and no distinguishing properties other than lithium enhancement, the origin of lithium-rich giant stars is one of the oldest problems in stellar astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of 2330 low-mass (1-3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) lithium-rich giant stars, which we argue are consistent with internal lithium production that is driven by tidal spin-up by a binary companion. Our sample reveals that most lithium-rich giants have helium-burning cores ({80}<SUB>-6</SUB><SUP>+7</SUP> % ), and that the frequency of lithium-rich giants rises with increasing stellar metallicity. We find that while planet accretion may explain some lithium-rich giants, it cannot account for the majority that have helium-burning cores. We rule out most other proposed explanations for the origin of lithium-rich giants. Our analysis shows that giants remain lithium-rich for only about two million years. A prediction from this lithium depletion timescale is that most lithium-rich giants with a helium-burning core have a binary companion.},

  abstract={In the local Universe, globular clusters (GCs) with metallicities [Fe/H] &lt; -2.5 are extremely rare. In this Letter, the close connection between GC formation and galaxy evolution is used to show that this GC metallicity `floor' results from the galaxy mass-metallicity relation of ultra low-luminosity galaxies (ULLGs) at high redshift, where the most metal-poor GCs must have formed. Galaxies with metallicities [Fe/H] ≲ -2.5 have too low masses to form GCs with initial masses M<SUB>i</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> needed to survive for a Hubble time. This translates the galaxy mass-metallicity relation into a maximum initial cluster mass-metallicity relation for [Fe/H] ≲ -1.8, which naturally leads to the observed colour-magnitude relation of metal-poor GCs at z = 0 (the `blue tilt'). Its strength traces the slope of the gas phase mass-metallicity relation of ULLGs. Based on the observed blue tilt of GCs in the Virgo and Fornax Clusters, the galaxy mass-metallicity relation is predicted to have a slope of α = 0.4 ± 0.1 for 10<SUP>5</SUP> ≲ M<SUB>⋆</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>7</SUP> at z ≳ 2.

If this scenario is correct, ω Cen should be tidally limited and tidal debris should be spread along its orbit. Here we use N-body simulations to show that the recently discovered `Fimbulthul' structure is the long-sought-for tidal stream of ω Cen, extending up to 28° from the cluster. Follow-up high-resolution spectroscopy of five stream stars shows that they are closely grouped in velocity, and have metallicities consistent with having originated in that cluster. Informed by our N-body simulations, we devise a selection filter that we apply to Gaia mission data to also uncover the stream in the highly contaminated and crowded field within 10° of ω Cen. Further modelling of the stream may help to constrain the dynamical history of the dwarf galaxy progenitor of this disrupting system and guide future searches for its remnant stars in the Milky Way.},

  abstract={We present a study using the second data release of the GALAH survey of stellar parameters and elemental abundances of 15 pairs of stars identified by Oh et al. They identified these pairs as potentially co-moving pairs using proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia DR1. We find that 11 very wide (&gt;1 pc) pairs of stars do in fact have similar Galactic orbits, while a further four claimed co-moving pairs are not truly co-orbiting. Eight of the 11 co-orbiting pairs have reliable stellar parameters and abundances, and we find that three of those are quite similar in their abundance patterns, while five have significant [Fe/H] differences. For the latter, this indicates that they could be co-orbiting because of the general dynamical coldness of the thin disc, or perhaps resonances induced by the Galaxy, rather than a shared formation site. Stars such as these, wide binaries, debris of past star formation episodes, and coincidental co-orbiters, are crucial for exploring the limits of chemical tagging in the Milky Way.},

  abstract={We construct from Gaia DR2 an extensive and very pure ({≲ } 0.2{{ per cent}} contamination) catalogue of wide binaries containing main-sequence (MS) and white dwarf (WD) components within 200 pc of the Sun. The public catalogue contains, after removal of clusters and resolved higher order multiples, &gt; 50 000 MS/MS, &gt; 3000 WD/MS, and nearly 400 WD/WD binaries with projected separations of 50 ≲ s/{au} &lt; 50 000. Accounting for incompleteness and selection effects, we model the separation distribution of each class of binaries as a broken power law, revealing marked differences between the three populations. The separation distribution of MS/MS systems is nearly consistent with a single power law of slope -1.6 over at least 500 &lt; s/au &lt; 50 000, with marginal steepening at s &gt; 10 000au. In contrast, the separation distributions of WD/MS and WD/WD binaries show distinct breaks at ∼3000 and ∼1500 au, respectively: they are flatter than the MS/MS distribution at small separations and steeper at large separations. Using binary population synthesis models, we show that these breaks are unlikely to be caused by external factors but can be explained if the WDs incur a kick of ∼0.75 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> during their formation, presumably due to asymmetric mass-loss. The data rule out typical kick velocities above 2 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our results imply that most wide binaries with separations exceeding a few thousand au become unbound during post-MS evolution.},

  abstract={The primary sample of the Gaia Data Release 1 is the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS): ≈2 million Tycho-2 sources with improved parallaxes and proper motions relative to the initial catalog. This increased astrometric precision presents an opportunity to find new binary stars and moving groups. We search for high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS by identifying pairs of stars consistent with having the same 3D velocity using a marginalized likelihood ratio test to discriminate candidate comoving pairs from the field population. Although we perform some visualizations using (bias-corrected) inverse parallax as a point estimate of distance, the likelihood ratio is computed with a probabilistic model that includes the covariances of parallax and proper motions and marginalizes the (unknown) true distances and 3D velocities of the stars. We find 13,085 comoving star pairs among 10,606 unique stars with separations as large as 10 pc (our search limit). Some of these pairs form larger groups through mutual comoving neighbors: many of these pair networks correspond to known open clusters and OB associations, but we also report the discovery of several new comoving groups. Most surprisingly, we find a large number of very wide (&gt; 1 pc) separation comoving star pairs, the number of which increases with increasing separation and cannot be explained purely by false-positive contamination. Our key result is a catalog of high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS. We discuss the utility of this catalog for making dynamical inferences about the Galaxy, testing stellar atmosphere models, and validating chemical abundance measurements.},

  abstract={Chemical tagging promises to use detailed abundance measurements to identify spatially separated stars that were, in fact, born together (in the same molecular cloud) long ago. This idea has not yielded much practical success, presumably because of the noise and incompleteness in chemical-abundance measurements. We have succeeded in substantially improving spectroscopic measurements with The Cannon, which has now delivered 15 individual abundances for ∼ {10}<SUP>5</SUP> stars observed as part of the APOGEE spectroscopic survey, with precisions around 0.04 dex. We test the chemical-tagging hypothesis by looking at clusters in abundance space and confirming that they are clustered in phase space. We identify (by the k-means algorithm) overdensities of stars in the 15-dimensional chemical-abundance space delivered by The Cannon, and plot the associated stars in phase space. We use only abundance-space information (no positional information) to identify stellar groups. We find that clusters in abundance space are indeed clusters in phase space, and we recover some known phase-space clusters and find other interesting structures. This is the first-ever project to identify phase-space structures at the survey-scale by blind search purely in abundance space; it verifies the precision of the abundance measurements delivered by The Cannon the prospects for future data sets appear very good.},

  abstract={It is now well-established that the elemental abundance patterns of stars hold key clues not only to their formation, but also to the assembly histories of galaxies. One of the most exciting possibilities is the use of stellar abundance patterns as “chemical tags” to identify stars that were born in the same molecular cloud. In this paper, we assess the prospects of chemical tagging as a function of several key underlying parameters. We show that in the fiducial case of 10<SUP>4</SUP> distinct cells in chemical space and {10}<SUP>5</SUP>-{10}<SUP>6</SUP> stars in the survey, one can expect to detect ∼ {10}<SUP>2</SUP>-{10}<SUP>3</SUP> groups that are ≥slant 5σ overdensities in the chemical space. However, we find that even very large overdensities in chemical space do not guarantee that the overdensity is due to a single set of stars from a common birth cloud. In fact, for our fiducial model parameters, the typical 5σ overdensity is comprised of stars from a wide range of clusters with the most dominant cluster contributing only 25% of the stars. The most important factors limiting the identification of disrupted clusters via chemical tagging are the number of chemical cells in the chemical space and the survey sampling rate of the underlying stellar population. Both of these factors can be improved through strategic observational plans. While recovering individual clusters through chemical tagging may prove challenging, we show, in agreement with previous work, that different CMFs imprint different degrees of clumpiness in chemical space. These differences provide the opportunity to statistically reconstruct the slope and high-mass cutoff of CMF and its evolution through cosmic time.},

  abstract={We present here a fast code for creating a synthetic survey of the Milky Way. Given one or more color-magnitude bounds, a survey size, and geometry, the code returns a catalog of stars in accordance with a given model of the Milky Way. The model can be specified by a set of density distributions or as an N-body realization. We provide fast and efficient algorithms for sampling both types of models. As compared to earlier sampling schemes which generate stars at specified locations along a line of sight, our scheme can generate a continuous and smooth distribution of stars over any given volume. The code is quite general and flexible and can accept input in the form of a star formation rate, age-metallicity relation, age-velocity-dispersion relation, and analytic density distribution functions. Theoretical isochrones are then used to generate a catalog of stars, and support is available for a wide range of photometric bands. As a concrete example, we implement the Besançon Milky Way model for the disk. For the stellar halo we employ the simulated stellar halo N-body models of Bullock &amp; Johnston. In order to sample N-body models, we present a scheme that disperses the stars spawned by an N-body particle, in such a way that the phase-space density of the spawned stars is consistent with that of the N-body particles. The code is ideally suited to generating synthetic data sets that mimic near future wide area surveys such as GAIA, LSST, and HERMES. As an application we study the prospect of identifying structures in the stellar halo with a simulated GAIA survey. We plan to make the code publicly available.},

  abstract={The formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the great outstanding problems of astrophysics. Within the broad context of hierachical structure formation, we have only a crude picture of how galaxies like our own came into existence. A detailed physical picture where individual stellar populations can be associated with (tagged to) elements of the protocloud is far beyond our current understanding. Important clues have begun to emerge from both the Galaxy (near-field cosmology) and the high redshift universe (far-field cosmology). Here we focus on the fossil evidence provided by the Galaxy. Detailed studies of the Galaxy lie at the core of understanding the complex processes involved in baryon dissipation. This is a necessary first step toward achieving a successful theory of galaxy formation.},
