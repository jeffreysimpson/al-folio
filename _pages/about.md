I am an astronomer at the University of New South Wales. My research program uses the largest datasets of Milky Way stars to study the history of our Galaxy.

I have worked on the [biggest](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.22012.x) and [smallest](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stx2174) globular clusters, [the most ancient stream of stars](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2483-6), and pairs of stars from destroyed star clusters. 

I am a member of the Survey Management Group for the [GALAH Survey](https://www.galah-survey.org), and am a builder for the [Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey](https://s5collab.github.io).
